A breakdown of our code can be found on eddie.laravel.cloud in my Posts section. 

You can also download the file and test on Colab, Modal (my use case) or anywhere else you see fit. Feel free to make edits, and stay tuned for any further improvements down the road.

git clone https://github.com/Echen1246/GPT-E3.git
cd GPT-E3
# open the notebook in Modal or local Jupyter
